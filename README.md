I'm feeling desperate and mundane, I'm poking my eyes out
There is a fungus in my brain, oh I'm gonna spaz out
I'm gonna turn off the lights, don't need to see, 'cause I'm blind now
Some people told me I'm insane, that I'm losing my mind now

I'm asleep and lucid dreaming
Don't wake me up, 'cause I love the feeling
I'll sleep for months, yeah, I'm scared of seeing tommorow
Tommorow

Just let me break
There's nothing more to gain here, no
I'll always be just lurking in the darkness till I find my only soul
My only, my only

Can't stop reflecting on my past, I need absolution
My good relationships don't last, the hate is solution
Can't let them know that I'm nice, or thеy will act I'm illusion
The spiders crawling in my bed, just ain't no dеlusion

I'm asleep and lucid dreaming
Don't wake me up, 'cause I love the feeling
I'll sleep for months, yeah, I'm scared of seeing tommorow
Tommorow
